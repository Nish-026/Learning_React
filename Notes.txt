WHAT IS REACT?

React is an open source library for building user interfaces. Remember, it's not a framework.

Why React? It is created and maintained by facebook

=> React has a component based architecture
=> Reusable code
=> React is declarative
=> DOM updates are handled gracefully
=> React native is for mobile applications

=> command for creating new react project = npx create-react-app first_app

Components

There are mainly five Components
1. Header
2. Main content
3. Sidenav
4. Footer
5. Root(App) component

The component code is placed in javascript file whereas App component is placed in APP.js 

Component Types

1. Stateless Functional component = javascript functions. There is absence of this in functional components

function welcome(props){
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

2. Stateful class component

Class extending component class 
Render method returning HTML

example: 
class welcome extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
    }
}

Functional components in detail: are just javascript functions they can optionally receive
javascript objects of properties returning HTML which describes the UI. The html here is called jsx


Class Components in detail

class components are ES6 classes, can receive properties(props) and can return HTML(JSX)
=> can contain private info also

But with the latest version of react, Hooks were introduced
Hooks are a new feature proposal that lets you use state and other react features without writing a class.

JSX
Javascript XML (jsx)- Extension to the javascript language Syntax
write XML like code for elements and components
JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children

What are props?

Props stand for "Properties." They are read-only components. 
It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and 
work similar to the HTML attributes. It gives a way to pass data from one 
component to other components. It is similar to function arguments. 
Props are passed to the component in the same way as arguments passed in a function.

Props are immutable that means you cannot reassign values to them


Props vs state

=> Props get passed to the component wherease state is managed within the component
=> Function parameters whereas in state, the variables are declared in the function body
=> Props are immutable, state can be changed
=> props = functional components, this.props = class components whereas in state, useState Hook = Functional Components and this.state is the class components

List and keys

   A key is a special string attribute you need to include when creatinf lists of element
   Keys gives the elements a stbale identity
   Keys help react identify which items have changed, are added or are removed


// Styling React Components
1. CSS stylesheets
2. Inline Styling
3. CSS modules
4. CSS in JS libraries

lifecycle methods available for a class component (these methods does not apply to functional component)
there are mainly 4 methods
1. Mounting => When an instance of a component is being created or inserted into the DOM
2. updating => When a component is rerendered as a result of changes to either its props or state
3. Unmounting => When a component is being removed from the DOM
4. Error Handling => When there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component

  Mounting
  Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.
  
  React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

  =1.constructor()
  =2.getDerivedStateFromProps() == When the state of the component depends on changes in props over time and set the state
  =3.render() == Read props & state and return JSX, Do not change state or interact with DOM or make AJAX calls
  =4.componentDidMount() == Invoked immediately after a component and all its children components have been rendered to the DOM
  The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.

  Updating
  The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.

  A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.

  React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

  =1.getDerivedStateFromProps()
  =2.shouldComponentUpdate()
  =3.render()
  =4.getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
  =5.componentDidUpdate()
  The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.

  Unmounting
  The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.

  React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:

  componentWillUnmount()
  componentWillUnmount
  The componentWillUnmount method is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.
